<h3>Project Overview </h3>

Researchers have explored how online communities can be leveraged for peer support, but general disinterest and a lack of engagement have emerged as substantial barriers to their use in practice. 
To address this gap, I used the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and games user research, to create a serious game that motivates individuals to become peer supporters using the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) techniques.
<p><p>I conducted a <b>mixed-methods, exploratory study</b> to evaluate Merlynne&apos;s design and specifically studied the Proteus Effect, hypothesizing that players using a stereotypically helpful avatar would have higher usage rates and a higher change in helping 
attitudes scores (HAS) than players using a stereotypically unhelpful avatar.

                </div>
						<div class="modal-body text-left container">
<h3>Problem </h3>
The Proteus Effect is when an individual is influenced by the stereotypes of their avatar in virtual spaces to act differently in reality. I wished to determine if using avatars with stereotypically helpful appearances can motivate male-identifying individuals in particular to participate in peer to peer support through a game interface. 
<p><p>
Findings were to be interpreted as design suggestions to improve online mental health platform engagement, an identified problem in literature and industry.
</div>

<!-- Approach -->
<div class="divider-custom">
 <div class="divider-custom-line"></div>
</div>

						<div class="modal-body text-left container">
<h3>Approach</h3>
Merlynne was created in consultation with health groups, ethics boards, HCI experts, and existing literature in HCI and mental health.
<p><p>
<h5>Determining Content</h5>
<p>
Early <b>discussions with mental health and education groups</b> supported the idea of gamified peer support, with additional interest in the way male-identifying individuals used online peer support services. 
We had wished to use real-time reddits posts on university subreddits -available publically- however, due to <b>ethics limitations</b> of our institution's research ethics board, it was important 
for posts to be untraceable. In agreement of the concern, we instead paraphrased reddit posts to be representative of themes discussed on choice subreddits. Participants were convinced of its authenticity in interviews. 
 <p><p>
 <h5>Iterative Design</h5>
<p>
<p>
Early proofs of concepts of different games were presented for <b>roundtable discussions with HCI experts</b> generating feedback.
Raised issues included problematic narratives and incentives to cheat. As a solution, we <b>consulted literary expertise</b> and involved social elements to dissuade cheating.
<p><p>
<img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/demo/1b.png" alt="">

<p><p>
Early prototypes of Merlynne then underwent <b>playtests</b> with graduate student colleagues using <b>talk-alouds</b> and <b>interviews</b>. 
Confusions in flow and causes of breaks in immersion were identified, and changes were applied between each playtest.
<p><p>
For the purpose of my MSc research on the Proteus Effect, two avatar conditions (Monster and Cleric) were created based on literary research from the media arts field with feedback from peers studying language in gaming.

<h3>Research </h3>
<p>
A 2 hr in-lab study was held, with 36 male participants recruited from a graduate mailing list and posters from the University of Waterloo campus.
Participants completed <b>pre-post surveys</b> containing HAS scales before and after a 30-40 minute play session using a random avatar condition, followed by a <b>semi-structured interview</b>.
<p><p>
Peer support responses collected in-game from participants were assessed for adherence to CBT format by three researchers (with high <b>inter-rater reliability</b>). 
Data-driven <b>thematic analysis</b> using open and axial coding was used to interpret interviews, supported by <b>inferential statistics </b> with non-parametric tests (Mann Whitney U) of <b>usage data</b> including aformentioned responses coded for CBT format adherence.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
My thesis was successfully defended, and the Merlynne tool was packaged to be accessible to future researchers looking into peer support through RPG interfaces.
	<p><p>
Through this project, I adopted a <b>systems-based thinking</b> due to the many moving parts (development, content, research, feedback) within a short time frame.
A major personal takeaway was the need to <b>self-organize</b> and <b> learn quickly </b>.
	<p><p>
	<h5>What I would have done differently: </h5>
<ul><li><b>
Selective sampling</b> of persons knowledgeable of RPG mediums to test the Proteus Effect specifically. The Proteus Effect requires the user to recognize stereotypes associated with avatars. Although tested for, many participants revealed they were not familiar with fantasy rpg archetypes in interviews.
This change will reduce the generalizability of study results, yet as our purpose was exploratory study focusing on the presence of the Proteus Effect, selective sampling will provide a more accurate measurement.</il>
<p><li>
<b>Modded a pre-existing game</b> to reduce barriers for immersion due to low fidelity of aesthetics and design. 
</li><p><li>
<b>Involved the real concerns</b> of individuals, and asked them to validate the effectiveness of the peer support received. Although researchers rated the reponses, we could not measure for true helpfulness given they were not the original posters. 
</li> <p><li>
<b>
Recorded gameplay footage
</b>
either through <b>video</b> or <b>keylogging</b> to understand the participants' gameplay choices. Where the player was clicking, travelling with their avatar, and how they structured their responses was not documented in our study, but the qualitative data could hold insight into the usage data. 
For example, if a player spent longer than usual on a level, were they exploring the map, rethinking their responses, or just idle?  Eye-tracking would also show player behaviour, especially in measuring the amount of attention they gave to the avatar but that would have higher set-up costs and risk inconsistencies.
</li>
 </ul>
 <p><p>
 Specific to technical development, there were many Unity techniques I later learned which would have benefited Merlynne such as linking all text objects to a database (e.g. Firebase, or a spreadsheet) for easier content management, using tags to classify NPCs, and using Scriptable Objects
 to manage the status of interactive objects. <p><p>
 I would have also stored the incoming data natively to an excel spreadsheet to reduce the risk of losing Google conenctivity or the status of my account if it were to be used by future researchers. 

 <p><p>
 <h5>Next Steps and Questions </h5>
<p><p>
The following questions were identified:
<p><p>

<ul><li><b>
How familiar should a person be with an archetype for the Proteus Effect to occur? 
</b> If the Proteus Effect occurred and suggestions were made to designers about which types of avatars to use, recent and classic media trends would need to be considered. If a current trend was to rewrite a traditional archetype (ie. a helpful monster or a damaging cleric), 
how long would this trend need to exist for to be relevant to the Proteus Effect? Alternatively, if designers were to build a character behind an avatar, how well would the player need to be familiar with the character?

</il>
<p><li>
<b>What is appropriate feedback for peer support?</b> Participants anticipated more motivation to help if their responses were validated to be helpful, either in-game or otherwise. Designing appropriate feedback that encourages peer participation without encouraging harmful participation would be an 
area of future research
</li><p><li>
<b>Are there gender differences?</b> Given our participant pool of male-identifying individuals, o
ther genders may yield different results. The relationship between genders and gendered avatars is of interest.</li>
 </ul>

 In final reflection, I believe the philosophical question of whether peer support should be encouraged with gamification 
 needs to be revisited, as in-game incentives can lessens the reflection of impact of support. Mental health expert involvement is suggested.

<h3>Project Overview </h3>
The MUSEUM in Kitchener, Ontario held the ALARM exhibition to press the urgency of action for climate change. 
In cooperation with the The Interdisciplinary Centre on Climate Change (IC3), the Games Institute contracted myself and others to <b>develop an interactive public display</b> to demonstrate current and future steps which can be done to <b>mitigate effects of climate change</b> to daily life. Titled Illuminate, the display used a visual novel game interface to feature three Canadian landscapes (Coastal, Urban, and Rural) which would change depending on adaptations (ie. solar panels, building regulations) chosen by museum guests in a narrative. Illuminate was to be on display in the MUSEUM in early 2020.

<h3>Problem</h3>
IC3 recognized the need to educate families with young children on steps already being done to mitigate effects of climate change on daily life to convey hope in their future.
				</div>

<!-- Approach -->
<div class="divider-custom">
 <div class="divider-custom-line"></div>
</div>

						<div class="modal-body text-left container">
<h3>Approach</h3>
A core production team comprised of a writer, developer, and artist (myself) worked within the Games Institute to design an installation encouraging hope in The MUSEUM's ALARM exhibit, with administrative staff support managing communications with IC3 and The MUSEUM. 
The project kicked off in November 2019 with January 2020 in <b>consultation with climate scientists</b> of IC3. 
Discussions lead to acknowledgment of the short runway for the project from all parties and decided on a <b>module-based game</b> for Illuminate. 
Three playable modules were to be completed by January 2020, with opportunities for more modules to be added in early February 2020 if needed. Two weeks of testing time was scheduled into the plan.
<p><p>
<h5>Workflow Management</h5>
<p>Recurring meetings took place within the production team (writer, developer, artist), and research team (writer, administrative staff, IC3) to <b>support concurrent workflow</b>. 
Communications were exchanged internally on Slack and externally via email and a shared OneDrive. 
<b>The management system was consistently used</b> and effectively led to a scalable prototype developed by the time the writing was finalized.
<p><p>
<h5>Considering Legacy</h5>
<p> The developer and I (artist) were not scheduled to continue our contracts, thus if new modules were to be added post-January, both the <b>game environment and the art assets must be scalable</b>. 
In the case no new programming and art talent was available, it was ensured all future assets could be added within the game engine's environment (Unity) without scripting, and a <b>low-barrier art style was used</b>. Barriers to artwork were seen as poor art fundamentals such as (1) line control; (2) colour theory; and (3) drawing from memory. Thus, art style chosen used feathered brushes which did not require precise line weight control, a colour palette was pre-chosen for future art, and realistic proportions were used for future artwork to be produced through rotoscoping.

<h3>Design</h3>
Iluminate's design needed to attract and engage museum guests in a large public space to on handheld tablet. 
Guest attention was a rare commodity among other attractive displays and their time may be limited. 
Thus, <p>
<ul>
<li><b>the game loop must be quick</b> for guests to quickly take away a learnable experience</li>
<li><b>the installation as a whole must be attractive</b> to convince guests to approach the display</li>
</ul>

<p><p>
<b>MUSEUM space</b>
<img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/demo/3.png" alt="">

Game loops were kept short (30 secs to 2 min play), asking players only three questions each landscape scenario, with 3-4 options per question to ensure replayability. A second monitor with a trailer video was also set up to display potential gameplay to passersby to garner interest in interacting. <p><p>
<p><p>
<h5>Gameplay</h5>
<p> TBA.

						<div class="modal-body text-left container">
<h3>Testing</h3>
Conversations with The MUSEUM and IC3 took place to understand the definition of success for the installation. As a development team, we wished to deliver a product by January with understandable flows accurate to the latest climate science and fit The MUSEUM's branding.
<p><p>
<h5>Expert Review</h5>
<p>
A finished prototype of one landscape (coastal) was <b>presented as a demo</b> to IC3, and narrative and artwork of remaining landscapes were presented as text and image files. 
Through email discussions and a <b>working shared spreadsheets file</b>, IC3 provided feedback in writing with relevant sources. 
Narrative and artwork was updated with their insight.<p><p>
<p>
<h5>
Talk-Alouds
</h5>
<p>
External to the core team, testing was performed on student volunteers in the Games Institute <b>over lunch on their personal mobile devices</b>. 
Students were asked to play through scenarios and voice aloud their thoughts and concerns during the playthroughs. 
Inconsistencies between narrative and art were brought up, as well as minor confusions in UI (e.g. buttons were not obviously leading to intended screens). Changes were applied quickly from testing and tested again internally before launching.

<h3>Impact</h3>
Illuminate was ready for installation for the MUSEUM in January 2020 in the MUSEUM, successfully:<p><p>
<ul><li><b>
Educating potential MUSEUM guests</b> on possible adaptations to climate change</il>
<p><li>
<b>Providing a scalable model for an interactive public display</b> if IC3 and the Games Institute wishes to expand on the project to incorporate other landscapes such as artics, suburbs, or mountains
</li><p><li>
<b>Creating an artifact for research for the Games Institute</b> for future research opportunities and display at open house events</li>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
The project was successful in process and delivery with strengths in teamwork and transparency across parties during the development process despite competing priorities during the short runway. 
I learned to <b>ask the right questions</b> from subject matter experts to make sure artwork was representative of their messaging.<p><p>
<h5>
What I would have done differently
</h5>
<p><p>
I prioritized art assets for the Illuminate interface, but in retrospect the <b>art should have considered the installation concept as a whole</b> from print advertisements to video trailers. The colour schemes and iconography chosen for the gameplay were lighter in colour and storybook-like to appeal to both children (storybook readers) and adults (storybook buyers). Although effective for the visual-novel game interface, the style may not be as attractive to the passerby in a busy public space, especially when compared to previous displays by the Games Institute like Quantum Cats, which has graphics easily translatable to its promotional materials.
<p><p>
In the future I would also use <b>vectors for images for better scaling across different screen sizes</b> and I would be interested in exploring the .psb file setting instead of saving each layer (through batch processing script) to be imported into Unity to enable animations.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
Healthcare providers (ie. pharmacists, family physicians, chiropractors) request <b>patient experience feedback</b> to improve their 
workflow and care, but ris patients&apos;s poor memory with delayed phonecalls and paper surveys are inconvenient to administer in high traffic areas.
Smartsurveys presents as a solution by prompting patients with electronic surveys when they enter a (&apos;geofenced&apos;) location such as a doctor&apos;s office. 
As a researcher, I organized a <b>field study</b> in a team of 4 for 200 participants within the Kitchener-Waterloo community, while co-supervised by Dr. Josephine McMurray of WLU and Dr. James Wallace of UW.
The study design was presented at the 2018 ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces.				</div>

						<div class="modal-body text-left container">
<h3>Problem</h3>
Providers need affordable and effective ways to collect feedback, and smartphone applications present as suitable solutions. 
However, previous research shows that patients are hesitant to provide smartphone-based feedback in a care setting due to 
perceived risks and apparent futility of expecting change as a result.

<h3>Approach</h3>
I extended the work of a previous graduate student who observed that patients had privacy concerns about sharing health information over personal smartphones. 
The second phase of the project aimed to understand: <p> 
<ul>
<li><b>Context Sensitivity</b> and whether individuals would actually report less information to health providers.</li>
<li><b>Reasons for declining</b> to give service feedback to providers of any type</li>
</ul>
A field study was designed to measure individuals&apos; willingness to provide feedback to health providers compared to non-health service providers (ie. banks, theatres, car maintenance shops) using the MetricWire app to host the study tool. <p>
<p><p>
MetricWire is a data collection tool developed in Kitchener-Waterloo by the startup MetricWire Inc., who were also collaborators on the NSERC-Engage grant funding SmartSurveys. In regular meetings with the MetricWire team, I came to discover the limitations and opportunities with their tool concurrently with their startup development.

<h3>Research</h3>
I led the implementation of the SmartSurveys tool, which included its onboarding materials, development, and testing. <p><p>
<h5>Study Design and Materials</h5><p>
Participants were recruited online and directed to enroll in the SmartSurveys study on the MetricWire app through a <b>one-page website</b>. The website linked to <b>consent letters</b> and <b>installation guides</b> hosted on Google Drive. 
When SmartSurveys was installed, participants would complete an intro survey to complete enrollment, then be given surveys through MetricWire every time they dwelled in a geofenced location.
<p><p>
<img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/demo/5d.png" alt="">
<b>Automatically measured variables</b> included situated usage data such as time spent in a geographic area, time between entering a location and submitting feedback, and between the time of exit and feedback submission. Overall activity data like the number of submissions, and the number of words per submission was also tracked to be compared between locations.

<p><p>

<h5>Tool Design</h5><p><p>
I <b>trained</b> two undergraduate research assistants to collect the geographical coordinates and radial size of service providers in Kitchener-Waterloo based on Google map data. <p><p>
Four lists of geofences were created, containing 100-150 locations on each list.<p>
<ul>
<li>On Campus* - Health Provider</li>
<li>Off Campus** - Health Provider</li>
<li>On Campus - Non-health Provider</li>
<li>Off Campus - Non-health Provider</li> </ul><p>
* On the WLU or UW campus<p>
** In the Kitchener-Waterloo region<p><p>
 <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/demo/5b.png" alt="">

<h5>Tool Testing</h5><p><p>
After the locations were programmed into the SmartSurveys tool, we <b>tested the sensitivity</b> of the MetricWire app to geofences on foot using different smartphones and operating systems (iPhone, Android). <p><p>
 <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="img/demo/5c.png" alt=""> <p>

There were overlapping geofences due to multi-service buildings with multiple floors with different services. It was difficult to differentiate services leading to the over-triggering of surveys. As a <b>solution</b>, an extra question was asked in multi-service buildings asking participants to indicate where they were in a form field.
<p><p>
Some geofences also did not fire when entered, as Android phones were not registering the geofence as quickly to save battery life. This posed as a study problem as iPhone and Android users would have inconsistent participant experiences. As a <b>short-term fix</b>, I changed the trigger from &apos;dwelling in an area&apos; to &apos;exiting an area&apos; to at least ensure all participants received notifications after service provision instead of some during and some after. <p><p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
Technological barriers to implementation remained after my involvement, but a good foundation was set for the project
to continue once problems were fixed. Strengths were in project organization leading to quick and effective meetings given the 
competing priorities of all parties. Through this project I learned a lot about <b>knowledge translation</b> and <b>project management</b> 
within a interdiscinplinary team with remote team members.

<p><p>
<h5>What I would have done differently</h5> <p><p>
One major barrier to implementation was the inconsistency of geofences firing for different smartphone users. Despite the investment in tool setup, I would have <b>explored other ways to measure contextual sensitivity</b>. 
<p><p>
The study could have sent participants surveys to complete through MetricWire according to a predetermined time schedule. 
Participants would report where they were and offer feedback if willing. 
Although less relevant data points may be collected (e.g. if the participant was at home most of the survey times), it would have been <b>independent of GPS error</b>.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
In communications with Unicef Mongolia and Dr. Plinio Morita of the Ubiquitous Computing Lab at the University of Waterloo, my colleague Marcela Costa and I <b>advised the development of LIFEHACK, an educational simulation game</b> made by youth in Ulaanbataar around sexual health, drug use, and other topics. The result was an example of global collaboration using local knowledge of the startups and the software development life cycle (SDLC) in Kitchener-Waterloo, and local knowledge of youth experiences in Ulaanbataar to <b>co-create health products</b>. The project was presented at a Toronto conference on global health.

<h3>Problem</h3>
An initial meeting over Skype with the LIFEHACK team was facilitated by a translator (Russian to English, English to Russian) from Unicef Mongolia. Mock-ups and pitch decks previously provided were reviewed and the following problems were shared:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Difficulty sustaining player engagement</b></li><p>
<li><b>Lack of development talent</b></li>

</ul> <p>
It became known in future meetings that a prototype needed to be developed for LIFEHACK to renew funding from Unicef Mongolia, thus the <b>short runway for development</b> was acknowledged.

<h3>Approach</h3>
The original approach proposed by LIFEHACK was to create 6 personas the player can play as through 6 different lifestyles, through 12 different topics. 
Each persona and topic combination would feature unique narrative, art, and minigames (ie. a basketball hoop shooting game for the fitness-related topic) to add interest to the narrative gameplay. Although comprehensive, the proposed content and development heavy approach was misaligned with the LIFEHACK team&apos;s timeline.
<p><p>
In <b>review of the LIFEHACK&apos;s vision, resources, and talent</b>, the teams&apos; strengths laid in their lived experiences as youth growing up in Mongolia, connections to experts in Unicef Mongolia, and artistic talent (graphic design, photography, writing). 
<p><p>
Through two more <b>video calls</b>, we further understood the vision of LIFEHACK to bring the game into middle school classrooms, and shared our intentions to use concepts from Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and iterative testing in the SDLC to help them develop their project.				</div>

All opinions were presented as suggestions in the interest of faster development, and it was made clear that they were to prioritize their vision if they saw conflict in suggestions.

<h3>Proposal</h3>
The following suggestions were presented to the LIFEHACK team prioritizing prototype development and scaling:<p><p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Prototype.</b> Focus on creating one storyline (one persona, one topic) that has a clear flow and thoughtful content. A minimally viable prototype (MVP) allows for early testing to identify issues and inconsistencies before investing in scaling more content. 
The perfected flow (including research processes and internal team management systems) can then be replicated for more storylines to reduce technical debt. Developers can be later hired to create high-fidelity products from a tested prototype.</li><p>
<li>
<b>Focus on narrative.</b> Given the limited programming talent on the Mongolian team, it was advised that minigames would be difficult to create in short time. 
The assumption that narrative alone cannot be engaging should be tested, as narrative content can be created quickly with art talent and little programming. </li><p>
<li>
<b>Introduce multiplayer.</b> Providing social relatedness, a psychological need according to SDT, could contrsibute to intrinsic motivation to continue play. If designed for classroom play, social elements could encourage discussion to explore imapcts of life choices beyond the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact</h3>
In consideration of proposed changes, LIFEHACK chose to focus on one topic (drug use), and consider other elements in future designs. 
<p><p>
This consultation effort was presented as a poster as an example of global collaboration health research and game development.

<h3>Reflection</h3>
The consultation project was exemplar of how local development knowledge from the Kitchener-Waterloo region could be applied to the development of products in international markets. 
It was an honour being a part of LIFEHACK&apos;s development and I believe it will have a positive impact on Mongolian classrooms when successful.
Through this project I was able to learn about needs for software development in a global health context such as funding cycles and <b>mobilizing talent effectively</b>.
As I was an outside consultant, I practiced <b>appreciative inquiry</b> and refrained from paternalistic suggestions to <b>respect</b> the Mongolian team&apos;s vision.'
I also deliberately made conversation points <b>concise for effective translation</b> over video calls.
<p><p>
<h5>What I would have done differently</h5><p>
It was assumed that the availability of developers and classrooms in Mongolia were similar to the Canadian environment. If time and opportunity had allowed it, 
it would have been worthwhile <b>understanding the startup and game development ecosystem (e.g. talent costs) in Ulaanbaatar</b> outside of LIFEHACK&apos;s experiences to provide more insightful advice.
